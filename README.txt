Before we begin, we wish to apologize for not meeting the
critera for the assignment. We understand this was supposed
to you a .jar file to complete this assignment, however we
had issues and complications and wanted to provide some
result for you to grade. We hope you understand and thank
you for taking the time to grade our project.

Instructions to run the code:

While it is rather simple, you will be given a small menu
of options to select from. Simply this will give you a
list of the files you can import from. Afterwards it will
print the time it takes between each sorting algorithm in
milliseconds to properly go through all the data in the text
files and sort them accordingly. Afterwards it will print
the sorts from most efficient to least efficient.
